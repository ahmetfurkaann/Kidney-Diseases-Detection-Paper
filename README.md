Kidney diseases are one of the most common diseases worldwide and cause unbearable pain in most people. In this study aims to
detecting the cyst and stone in the kidney. For the this purpose, YOLO architecture designs were used for detection of kidney, kidney
cyst and kidney stone. The YOLO architecture designs were supported by the explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) feature. CT images
in three classes, namely 72 kidney cysts, 394 kidney stones and 192 healthy kidneys were used in the performance analysis part of the
YOLO architecture designs. As a result, YOLOv7 architecture design outperformed the YOLOv7 Tiny architecture design. YOLOv7
architecture design achieved the mAP50 of 0.85, precision of 0.882, sensitivity of 0.829 and F1 score of 0.854. Consequently, deep
learning based xAI assisted computer aided diagnosis (CAD) system was developed for diagnosis of kidney diseases.
